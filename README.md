## Configuration

The application uses `appsettings.json` for configuration. Important settings include:

- **ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection** â€” database connection string.
- **JwtSettings:**  
  - `SecretKey`: Secret key for JWT token signing (keep it safe and private).  
  - `Issuer`: Token issuer identifier.  
  - `Audience`: Intended audience of the token.  
  - `ExpirationMinutes`: Token validity duration in minutes.

You can override these settings via environment variables in production.
